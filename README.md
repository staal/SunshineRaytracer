### Roadmap
Below is a non exhaustive list of features I want finished before stepping onto more complicated rendering algorithms.
- [ ] Support for textures.
- [ ] Multi object support (transformations)
- [ ] Multi threaded rendering
- [ ] Documentation for all old files
- [ ] Add tests for the engine sub project.
- [ ] Get an initial simple Qt UI OpenGL window up and running.
- [ ] Proper file format for own Sunshine Scenes.

### Dependencies
- GLM for math.
- Boost.spirit for parsing file formats
- Boost.filesystem and Boost.program_options for paths and commandline arguments
- Qt for the main ui application
